### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eirik and I'm a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU that will graduate in 2022. I have an interest in data science, and enjoy applying theory to practical situations.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working part time as a systems engineer at <a href=https://www.uninett.no/>Uninett</a>. In the summer of 2021 I worked as a data scientist intern in Uninett where I used unsupervised anomaly detection to discover malicious network intrusions for FEIDE.

- :ocean: I've previously worked on modeling water flow in a river close to my home in Trondheim with the team `Rage Against the Machine Learning` using data provided by [NVE](https://www.nve.no/): For more on this project, see [Water Flow Modeling Using Shrinkage Methods](https://github.com/ebbeberge/water-flow-modeling).

- :computer: I love talking about topics related to programming. Combined with my passion for teaching, this has forced me to make education videos about Python. If you speak Norwegan and don't (yet) know Python, then you can take a look at the free course [Introduction to Python in Norwegian](https://github.com/ebbeberge/python_course_norwegian) I have made. I've recently started making Python & LaTeX videos on YouTube for fun, so check out [TM Quest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM0hH04kGHmn3ftlf5x1NQ ) if you are interested in this.

- :nerd_face: I've published papers in international peer-reviewed journals on different mathematical topics. In particular, I wrote a paper called `Interpolation in Wavelet Spaces and the HRT-Conjecture` that was recently published in `Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications`. The paper investigates high-dimensional kernels that can be used for support vector machines algorithms. You can find a overview of my papers on my [homepage](http://folk.ntnu.no/eiber/) or on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eirik_Berge).
