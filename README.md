### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eirik and I'm a PhD graduate in mathematics with a passion for data science and data engineering. I enjoy applying theory to practical situations and to solve real life problems that bring value to customers and end-users.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working at Itera as a mixture between a data scientist and data engineer.

- :ocean: If you want to see an open access project I've previously done, you can check out the following: I've previously worked on modeling water flow in a river close to my home in Trondheim with the team `Rage Against the Machine Learning` using data provided by [NVE](https://www.nve.no/): For more on this project, see [Water Flow Modeling Using Shrinkage Methods](https://github.com/ebbeberge/water-flow-modeling).

- :computer: I love talking about topics related to programming and the data-sphere. Combined with my passion for teaching, this has forced me to make education videos about Python. If you speak Norwegan and don't (yet) know Python, then you can take a look at the free course [Introduction to Python in Norwegian](https://github.com/ebbeberge/python_course_norwegian) I have made. I've recently started making Python & LaTeX videos on YouTube for fun, so check out [TM Quest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM0hH04kGHmn3ftlf5x1NQ ) if you are interested in this.

- :nerd_face: I've published papers in international peer-reviewed journals on different mathematical topics. In particular, I wrote a paper called `Interpolation in Wavelet Spaces and the HRT-Conjecture` that was recently published in `Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications`. The paper investigates high-dimensional kernels that can be used for support vector machines algorithms. You can find a overview of my papers on my [homepage](http://folk.ntnu.no/eiber/) or on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eirik_Berge).
