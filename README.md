### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eirik and I'm a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU. I have an interest in data science, and enjoy applying theory to practical situations. I'm part of two machine learning teams, whose names are `Rage Against the Machine Learning` and `Random Florists and Decision Bees`. 

- :ocean: Iâ€™m currently working on modeling water flow in a river close to my home in Trondheim with the team `Rage Against the Machine Learning` using data provided by [NVE](https://www.nve.no/): For more on this project, see [Water Flow Modeling Using Shrinkage Methods](https://github.com/ebbeberge/water-flow-modeling).

- :computer: I love talking about topics related to programming. Combined with my passion for teaching, this has forced me to make education videos about Python. If you speak Norwegan and don't (yet) know Python, then you can take a look at the free course [Introduction to Python in Norwegian](https://github.com/ebbeberge/python_course_norwegian) I have made. 
<!-- I've recently started making Python & LaTeX videos on YouTube for fun, so check out [TM Quest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM0hH04kGHmn3ftlf5x1NQ ) if you are interested in this. -->

- :nerd_face: I've published papers in international peer-reviewed journals on different mathematical topics. In particular, I wrote a paper called `Interpolation in Wavelet Spaces and the HRT-Conjecture` that was recently accepted in `Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications`. The paper investigates high-dimensional kernels that can be used for support vector machines algorithms. You can find a overview of my papers on my [homepage](http://folk.ntnu.no/eiber/) or on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eirik_Berge).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about advanced statistical methods (`Lasso`, `Ridge Regression`, `Elastic Net`, `Group Lasso`, `Bagging`, `Boosting`, etc.) and some front-end development. I started making a small React app for practicing [touch typing in Norwegian](https://ebbeberge.github.io/typing/). It still needs some work (implementing a point system, more varied text options etc.), but it is functional and without a million ads every third minute. If you have any suggestions for this, please do not hessitate to let me know!
